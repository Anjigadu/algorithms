## Polling
Midterm elections are here! Help your local election commission by counting votes and telling them the winner. If more than one candidate ties with the most votes, print out all of their names in alphabetical order.

### Input
Each input will consist of a single test case. Each test case will begin with an integer *n*, ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 ), indicating the number of votes. The next *n* lines will hold the votes. The candidates’ names will appear one per line, and consist of between 1 and 20 capital letters only.

### Output
Output the name of the candidate with the most votes. If there is a tie, output out all of the names of candidates with the most votes, one per line, in alphabetical order. Do not output any spaces, and do not output blank lines between names.
