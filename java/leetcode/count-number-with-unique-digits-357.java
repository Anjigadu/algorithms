/**
 * Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 â‰¤ x < 10^n.
 *
 * This is a simple counting problem and be solved using combinatorics.
 * For every additional digit, there is n - 1 remaining digits since one was just used.
 * Because there are only 10 total digits, all combinations where n > 10 is equal to n = 10.
 * The base case is where n = 0 and the answer is 1.
