## Trie
#### Problem
A trie is similar to a tree, but the values that are stored are letters where each complete path is meant to store a word. This also goes by the name of prefix tree. The trie should have the following methods:

- `insert(word)` - Add the `word` into the structure.
- `match(prefix)` - Return all words that match the prefix.
- `search(word)` - Return true if the word exists in the trie.
